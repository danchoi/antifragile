# Antifragile


Some notes on The Black Swan and Antifragile, and what it may mean in
particular for programming.

Abbreviations:

* BS. The Black Swan
* A. Antifragile


BS 371. Avoid optimization; learn to love redundancy; overspecialization is not
a good idea


BS 377. Amor Fati: how to become indestructible

BS ch.6 the narrative fallacy: does this apply to software "best
practices"

  Platonicity is the desire for order, feeling of intellectual control
  over the environment. "The same condition that makes us simplify
  pushes us to think of that the word is less random than it actual is"
  BS 69.

BS 73 refers to "randomness laden professions" -- how does that apply to
software

BS ch.8 the problem of silent evidence.



Redundancies

BS 312. Mother Nature likes redundancies. Three types. 

Defensive. Spare parts, two eyes. Opp: naive optimization. Globalization
is prone to naive optimization.

Big is ugly and fragile. [connect to Unix philosophy]

  BS 315. Unforeseen errors and random shocks hurt large organisms more
  than smaller ones.

Species Density section. Large environments with lots of connectivity
allow more scaling -- but this is a bad thing. It comes at the expense
of species diverity. Fads will be more acute. [may apply as Ruby
community size grows bigger]
